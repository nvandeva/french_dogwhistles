**This thesis focuses on the study of dogwhistle emergence in France.**  
It proposes a multi-step method to  
**(1)** detect semantic divergence of expressions used in ideologically different communities of practice  
**(2)** explore whether meaning divergence, and associated ideological stance, can be detected through contextualized word embeddings.    

First, we compile two distinct corpora of French tweets by two ideologically different communities: a corpus of tweets by far-right users (the **“far-right”** corpus) and a corpus of tweets by non-far-right users (the **“non-far-right”** corpus). From both corpora, we extract a set of potential dogwhistles (PDs) which are expected to be used to convey a set of four predefined stances. Next we conduct an annotation task, where human annotators are asked to validate the association between PDs and stances for a sample of tweets from both corpora. The results of this task are then compared in a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the PDs’ vector embeddings and semantic neighbors in each corpus of tweets, as calculated by the French large language model (LLM) CamemBERTav2.   

We find that qualitative analysis is still the most valuable approach for the study of the emergence of potential dogwhistles through semantic divergence. Dogwhistle use relies on highly subtle pragmatic cues, such as speaker intentions and audience interpretation, usually accessible only to humans. Still, this thesis contributes a replicable framework for the study of the emergence of dogwhistles and other types of coded language. It also encourages its application in languages where dogwhistles are still left to be explored.
