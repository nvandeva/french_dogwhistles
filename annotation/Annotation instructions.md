**Annotation instructions**

Below are the detailed instructions provided to the annotators.

**1\.    Objective of the task**

You will annotate a corpus of 200  tweets. Each tweet includes a potential dogwhistle (PD)  which corresponds to a specific CONCEPT. 

•    There are  10 CONCEPTS,

•    Each CONCEPT has 20 tweets.

The CONCEPT can be used to express different stances.

You are asked to identify the stance conveyed in each tweet. There are five possible labels to choose from.

**2\.    Materials**  

You will receive:

•    A list of the five labels (four stance labels and one “none of the above” label), with their descriptions (point 3 below).

•    A list of CONCEPTS with their associated PDs, along with ideological and conventional meaning per CONCEPT (see Appendix A).

o    Each concept has two possible meanings:

    One meaning is ideological and aligns with one of the stance labels (xenophobic, islamophobic, anti-left, anti-EU).

    The other meaning is conventional, taken from the dictionary, and aligns with the “none of the above” label.

•    A list of cultural references on named entities and abbreviations which appear in the annotation dataset (see Appendix C).

•    An Excel sheet to perform the annotation (see Appendix D for an example).

**3\.    Labels**

The possible labels are: 

•    Islamophobic

Expresses hostility or discrimination specifically toward Islam or Muslims.

•    Xenophobic

Expresses anti-immigration sentiments or racial discrimination, often expressed through fear of foreigners.

•    Anti-EU

Rejects or criticizes the European Union, often linked to nationalism or sovereignty claims.

•    Anti-left

Rejects or criticizes left or progressive ideology, values and practices.

•    None of the above

Used when the PD does not express any of the above stances. 

Although some stances may overlap, you must select only one label per tweet.

**4\.    Annotation**

For each tweet:

•    Identify the CONCEPT and the underlined PD.

•    Interpret the context to decide which stance is expressed and select the appropriate stance label from the dropdown menu.

•    If unsure, use the “comment” column to flag your question—we’ll review together later.

One thing to keep in mind:

There are maximum 3 possible labels per CONCEPT 

•    1 or 2 stance labels (e.g., anti-EU \+ anti-left)

•    1 “None of the above” label

This means that one CONCEPT (= 20 tweets) cannot have more than 3 different labels assigned to it.  

**5\.    Example:** 

•    Concept: DYSTOPIA

PD : dystopie

Tweet : "La technologie avance à un rythme vertigineux, mais sommes-nous prêts pour les conséquences éthiques ? Le débat sur l'IA et la surveillance de masse soulève de vraies questions sur une potentielle dystopie future. » \#IA \#Technologie \#Société

Selected label  : none of the above 

•    Concept: DYSTOPIA

PD : orwell

Tweet : « On nous parle de « justice sociale » et de « réécriture de l'histoire », mais en réalité, c'est une entreprise de censure et de manipulation des esprits. La novlangue est la première étape d'une société à la orwell. » \#woke \#libertédexpression

Selected label  : anti-left

•    Concept: DYSTOPIA

PD : orwellien

Tweet : « Sous couvert de "démocratie européenne," l'UE instaure de plus en plus de contrôles centralisés, niant la souveraineté des peuples. Le Parlement de Bruxelles n'est qu'une façade pour un système de gouvernance autoritaire et orwellien. »

Selected label  : anti-EU   

Clarification of the maximum three label constraint: since three different labels have been assigned to the same concept, it is not possible to label the following tweets relating to DYSTOPIA as xenophobic or islamophobic.

**6\.    Comments**

•    If you struggle deciding on the right label, you can refer to the meanings which correspond to the ideological or conventional senses of the concepts.

•    Refer to the “labels” tab in the spreadsheet for quick reference on labels and to the “cultural references” tab for clarification of recurring named entities and abbreviations.

•    You can adjust the layout (e.g., widen rows/columns for readability). The entire text has been lowercased for ease of processing, but this should not hamper intelligibility.

Warning: contains hate speech. The tweets contain hateful, discriminatory, and emotionally charged content. If the content is particularly upsetting or disturbing to you, feel free to let me know and I will find someone else to help. Also, annotation is tiring. Don’t forget to take breaks\!
